# Shawn Banish - Project 2
This is my second project for CS 1520 - Pitt. My email is sjb111@pitt.edu where I can be contacted in regards to any thoughts/questions.

# Project Plan
My goal of this project was to create a portfolio for myself to use for potential job prospects. I did every thing that I was planning on doing in my initial plan, and I am happy with the results that I came up with. 

# Comments
I was able to improve on my project from the first part. I added PHP functionality, that sends the results of my contact form to a database. I fixed several small mistakes that I found on the first project. It should also be worth noting that I go into greater detail in regards to my changes in my write up located in the PDF folder.

# Additional Thoughts
I loved this course! I hope that we are able to get another version exploring more web dev in the future at Pitt!
